Trump,negative,Post-Caucus,2020-02-23,parisianxskies,"The only viable candidates are clearly Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, and Joe Biden. Every other candidate needs to drop out asap. @TheDemocrats are going to hand this election to Bernie, which will cause another four years of Trump - it''s 2016 all over again. #NevadaCaucus 3/3",33155,light,4082
Trump,negative,Post-Debate,2020-02-22,DicostanzoNick,Tomorrowin Nevada the Democrats will have a Caucus its candidates. But...Republicans have cancelled their Caucus in Nevada. Why? Because they believed that Bill Weld would do well against Trump. So what are they afraid of? The great leader is not so great. He is a buffoon.,33167,light,4083
Trump,negative,Post-Caucus,2020-02-23,24baseballReed,You can't be sure those were Democrats. Nevada cancelled their GOP caucus and gave all delegates to Trump which then would allow GOP to switch and vote Dem in the caucus. That is what is happening in the state where I live and the GOP are rather brazen about it https://twitter.com/thomaskaine5/status/1231630720910667781 …,33171,light,4084

Trump,negative,Pre-Debate,2020-02-19,wendyg113,That’s a desperate act on Bloomberg’s part. No one would believe Bernie would release such an ad of his former running mates in blood.
